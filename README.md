R scripts to demonstrate basic population and quantitative genetic analyses

[PopulationStructure.Rmd](PopulationStructure.Rmd) is a very quick and basic introduction to getting genetic data into R, filtering and recoding, and investigating minor allele frequencies, genomic relationships among individuals, relationships among markers, principal components and multi-dimensional scaling, and cluster analysis. ([Knitted html](PopulationStructure.html))

[GenomicPrediction.Rmd](GenomicPrediction.Rmd) is a brief introduction to summarizing phenotypic data to adjusted mean values, fitting GBLUP, RidgeRegression, and BayesC models, and evaluating prediction ability by cross-validation. ([Knitted html](GenomicPrediction.html))
